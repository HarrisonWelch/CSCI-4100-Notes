## Object oriented design principles

* Decompose the problem into objects
* Define the interface fir each object
  * make sure to use an abstraction so this can stay consistent
  * very difficult to change once set.
* Identify necessary internal state
  * AND invariant
  * invariant means something is true before an op happens and remains true after an operation finishes
* implement methods to manipulate the internal state.

## Shared objects require some additional steps

* liveness (operations make progress)

Five steps

1. Every shared object must have a lock
    1. only one thread can access internal state at one time
    2. JAVA has locks on all objects, effectively part of the lang
    3. C++ : add manual lock
2. Add code to require and release the lock
    1. aquire the lock at the beginning of every public method
    2. release the lock at the end of every public method
3. Identify and add condition variables
    1. Option 1: add a CV (condition variable) that a thread must wait for
    2. Option 2: use one conditional variable for all of these events and broadcast to all waiting threads
        1. each of threads receive the cast, they interpret.
        2. Waking up all threads to have them make a decision for maybe to result
        3. Use this with multiple events
4. Add loops to wait using the CVs
    1. Returning from wait in general does not guarantee
    2. improves modularity (makes few assumptions)
5. Add signal and broadcast
    1. signal - any one thread waiting CV can make progress
    2. broadcast - multiple threads / multiple conditions

## Best practices for shared objects

1. Follow a consistent structure
2. Always synchronize with locks and condition
    1. locks and CVs have been around alot and have been tested alot
    2. almost all stuff is built on locks and CVs
3. Always acquire the lock at the beginning of the method and release at the end
4. Always hold the lock when operating on a condition variable
5. Always wait in a while loop
    1. very tempting to using an if-statement
    2. "Mesa-semantic"
    3. very important that your code is modular
6. Do not use thread-sleep or having a thread volunterily yeild when a thread needs to wait for a condition to hold.
    1. these have uses but should not be used if a thread has to wait for a condition

## A __readers-writers lock__ (RWLock)

* Any number of reader threads can be granted access to read your shared data at the same time as long as no thread has right access has write access to write data at a time
* only one writer thread can be 

## RWLock operations

* start read - block caller until safe to read, then acquires the lock
* done read - used by the reader to release the lock
* start write - block caller until safe to write
* done write - used by writer to release the lock
