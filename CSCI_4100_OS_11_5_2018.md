A __translation lookaside buffer (TLB)__

* A cache in hardware is a cache in hardware contains the results of recent address translations
* A TLB entry contains a page #, a frame #, and a accesses permissions for the page
* When a processor needs to translate a VA the TLB is consulted first
* A __TLB hit__ occurs when the TLB contains an entry for a given page number
  * Then we don't have to address look-up at all
* A __TLB miss__ occurs when none of the entries in the TLB match, so we go through the normal address translation mechanism
  * normal address translation is used
* After a TLB miss, (once done w/ lookup) the address is added to the TLB containing the translation.
  * usually replacing an entry that has not been used recently
* Many systems have two levels of TLBs
  * 1st level - smaller and faster
  * 2nd level - larger and slower
* "How efficient is this???"
* 

```latex
Cost_{TLB} = cost of a TLB lookup
Cost_{full} = cost of a full address translation
P(hit) = probability of a TLB hit
Cost_avg = Cost_{TLB} + Cost_{full} * (1-P(hit))

```

The TLB hit rate can be imporved by a __superpages__

* A superpage is a set of contiguous pages that have been alloicated to contiguous page frames in memory aligned so that their addresses have the same higher order bits.
* "Add a little info to the TLB"
* Each TLB entry has also a flag indicating whether the translation is for a page or a superpage
* The 64-bit x86 processor can skip one or two levels of the page table provide 2MB or 1GB superpages instead of 4K pages
* Superpages are useful for mapping the frame buffer of a display or other large data structures in memory

Any time a cache is used, it has to be kept consistent with the original data 

* Problem of a process context switch
  * "2 options for switching processes"
  * flush and replace the cache
  * significantly impacts switching processes
  * include a processID in the TLB entries
* Permission change - affected TLB entries must be removed
* Multiprocessor system - TLB shootdown removes affected TLB entries from TLB each processor

Most processors don't only cache translations, eventually it became clear to cache the data itself

A Virtually addressed cache is actually checked even before consulting the TLB, indexed by virtual address

* A physically addressed cache is checked after an address translation, indexed by phyisical address translation, indexed by PA
* Many systems have multiple levels of physically addressed cache, w/ higher levels for each core and a shared lower level cache for all the processors

```
VA = virtual address

VA -> [VA Cache] ---miss---> [L1 TLB] ---miss---> [L2 TLB] ---miss---> [multi-level page table]

[VA] ---offset--> PA
[L1 TLB] -> Frame #
[L2 TLB] -> Frame #

Frame # -> PA -> [L1 cache] ---miss---> [L2 cache] ---miss---> [L3 shared cache] ---miss---> [main memory]
