--- 

1. Allocate and initialize the process control block
2. Allocate memory for the process
3. Load the program from disk into memory
4. Allocate a user-level stack
  * for all user process
5. Allocate a kernel level stack
  * so the kernel can handle interrupts
6. Copy command line arguments into user memory
7. Transfer control to user mode
8. Call a stub that calls the program's main function, then calls exit after it returns

```c++
void start() {
  main(argc, argv);
  exit();
}
```

## upcalls

Applications can be notified of events by the kernel using __upcalls__
  * User-level thread package can use a timer upcall to periodically switch threads
  * notify that asynchronous I/O
  * facilitate asynchronous interprocess communication
  * notify a process of an exception
    * wants to suspend process
  * adapt to change in resource allocation

## Booting the OS Kernel 

1. First, loads the basic input output system (BIOS) from read-only memory (ROM)
2. The BIOS reads the bootloader from the "boot disk" and loads this into memory. make sure something bad hasn't happened to it. Check for corruption.
  * generates a crpyto hash, this this then checked at boot-time
3. bootloader is responsible for loading the kernel and starts it.
4. The kernel inits its data structures & starts and initial process to start system services

## Virtual Machines

* run a guest OS on top of an existing host OS.
* in order for it to preform well, we can't have it emulate everything

The host OS starts up the guest OS
1. The host loads the guest bootloader and start it running.
2. The guest bootloader loads the guest kernel and starts it running
  * essentially an application. run it user-mode
3. Once the kernel is up and running, init its **interrupt vector table**
4. The guest kernel loads a process into memory that has been set aside specifically for the OS
5. to start the process, the guest traps into the host kernel
6. The host kernel makes sure the mode transfer, then restores the critical registers of the process, and starts the process running

## Guest process system call

* Guest process system call: traps host kernel
1. host kernel saves the critical registers on the interrupt stack of the guest OS
2. Host kernel transfers control to the guest kernel, which runs the interrupt handler in the user mode.
3. Guest kernel performs the system call
4. Guest kernel returns from the system call it traps into the host kernel 
5. The host kernel restores the state of the process and resumes it in user mode 
  * the host is only required to do the mode switch
