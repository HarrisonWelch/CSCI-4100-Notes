Processes takes turns running on the processor for a __time quantum__ or __time slice__

* Advantages: every task will eventually get to run preventing starvation
* Disadvantages:
  * short time quantum - adds overhead and increases average response time for some workloads
  * long time 

# Max-min fairness

* If all process are compute-bound, each one gets an equal share of the processor
* If you get a process that doesn't use its entire share, the remainder is distributed among the remaining processes
* Implementation: always give the processor to the process that has used it the least
* To avoid frequent switching, a process may be allowed to get 1 quantum ahead, but then it has to stop
* Advantages: optimizes for fairness
* Disadvantages: significant overhead to keep track of allocation shares

# Multi-level Feedback Queue (MFQ)

Think about FIFO again

* multiple queues track of tasks
* each queue corresponds to a diff priority level
* Higher priority tasks prempt the lower priority tasks but run with a shorter time quantum
* New tasks are put on the highest priority queue
* If a task uses up it's entire quantum and still has more work to do
* If a task yeild the processor to wait on I/O it stays at the same level or moves up
* Processes that have not recieved their fair share can be increase in priority
