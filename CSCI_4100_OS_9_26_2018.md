## Assignment question

## Thread applications

* each represents a single execution sequence
* Each thread is a separatly schedulable task

Each __thread scheduler__ switches between running and not-running threads

* Thread switches are transparent to the code running in each thread
* Each thread is running on a processor with unpredicatable speed
  * behave like they have own processor
* Threads don't make timing assumption
  * certian ops take a certain amount of actual time

## Why use this model?

* Allows programmer to write code independent of the scheduler
* less bug prone
  * has its own problems
* allows the kernel to suspend and resume threads at will
* Independent threads -> order of execution does not matter
  * user cannot control
* Threads that share data must use some sort of synchronization in order to maintain program correctness.
  * making one thread wait for another thread
  * maintain order, which means one needs to wait
* other outside factors can speed up or slow down program execution
  * can't make 100% about timing in program

## A simple thread API

* __thread_create__: creates a thread that executes a function with a function with a given set of arguments.
* __thread_yeild__: suspend the calling thread so that another thread can run
  * process make a system call to give up processor
* __thread_join__: (may be named differently) wait for a thread to finish and once done return the exit value of that thread
  * wait for a thread to finish
* __thread_exit__: exit the current thread (the caller) and stores the exit value in the thread's data structure and resume any thread waiting for it to exit
  * leave the thread

These ops implement threads as __Asynchronous procedure calls__

## fork-join parallelism

* a thread can use thread_create to create threads to perform work, and thread_join to wait for results
  * calling thread join on a thread that has already completed does no do anything
* The parent can safely send data to a child thread by writing it before the child starts
* The parents can recieve the data from the child by reading it after the child exits
* The child threads now have to work independently and not share data
  * in-order to avoid corruption, we need to have execution in order
  * message pass system
