## Assignment talk

* give appropriate message

## Shared objects

objects that can be safely accessed by multiple threads

## LOCK

A lock is a synchronization variable that provides __mutual exclusion__

* When one thread holds a lock, no other thread can hold it.
* A thread can make a sequence of instructions appear to be one atomic __critical section__ by holding the lock while executing those instrctions
* Each shared obj usually has one lock gaurding the state of the obj
* Locks allow a programmer to establish __invariants__

## Operations

* A lock can be in a BUSY or FREE state
* Initially the lock is FREE
* Acquire - wait unitl the lock is FREE then atomically makes the lock busy.
* If mulitple threads call acquire, only one is successful
* __release__ - makes the lock FREE and allows at most one and at least allows one thread AQUIRE it.

## Lock properties 

* __Mutual exclusion__ - at most one thread can hold the lock
* __Progress__ : if no thread holds the lock, then some thread can aquire it
* __Bounded Waiting__ : If a thread attempts to aquire the lock, there is only so long that theyt can be made to wait.
  * we have a bound on the number of times a thread can aquire

## Advice

* When a thread has a lock, don't do anything that can make it get stuck
* locks do not gaurantee usage correct
* get in, get out.
* make it simple, or simple set of items to accomplish

## Example

* A __bounded queue__ is a queue with a fixed capacity
* A __thread safe__ bounded queue is safe to use with mutliple threads
* State:
  * array of items w/ fixed capacity
  * \# of items added to queues
    * number of time over history
  * \# of items removed
  * a lock to gaurd the data
  * with this we know the size, empty, full
  * we can also cleverly know where to get things and where to put things
  * __back index__ can be computed by `added % capacity`
  * __front index__ can be compted by `removed % capacity`

## The Queue operations

Adding an item to the queue

1. Set the return value to false
2. Acquire the lock
3. If the queue is full, skip to step 7
4. Add the item provided to the queue
5. Increment the \# of items added
6. Set the return value to true
7. Release the lock
8. Return the "return value"

## Removing an item from the queue

1. Set the return value to false
2. Aquire the lock
3. If the queue is empty, skip to step 7
4. Copy the item from the front of the queue the front of the queue to the location to the location provided
5. Increment \# removed
6. Set return value to true
7. release the lock
8. return the "return val"
