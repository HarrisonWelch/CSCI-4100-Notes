Last time we talked about process management

## Input / Output

* Early computer systems provide customized programming interfaces for each device

* UNIX and other modern OS provide a single interface for any device input and output, for file operations and interprocess communication

### __Concepts__

* All I/O use the OPEN, CLOSE, READ, and WRITE
  * OPEN must be used first and returns a __file descriptor__ that can be used by subsequent READs and WRITES
    * have to provide "FD"
  * All data is stored in an array of bytes
  * Data being read is stored in a kernel buffer
    * allows data to know how fast is being read
  * If the buffer is empty, READ blocks the caller
  * Data being written is also stored in a kernel buffer
    * if this buffer is full, the write system blocks the caller
  * CLOSE - signals to the OS that the process is done with the file device or communication channel
* A __pipe__ is a kernel buffer that can be written by one process and read from by another process
* PIPE creates a pipe.
* DUP2 system that replaces the open file descriptors with a process

## Implementing a Shell

Every UNIX process has three open file descriptors

* fd0 - standard input
* fd1 - standard output
* fd2 - standard error

Command line processing

1. The shell reads and parses the command line to extract the command and its agruments
2. The shell calls FORK to create a child process with copies of the same FDs as its parent

a UNIX process does not know where its input is comping from to where its output is going

* a program called a shell script can be file containing a sequence of commands for the shell to execute
* a program can have output redirected to a file
* a program can have input redirected to a file
* one program can write to a pipe, and another can read from a pipe
* multiple programs can use pipes to set up a pipeline

## Interprocess communication

* A __producer__ generates output, which is read and processed by a __consumer__
* A __client__ sends a request to a __server__, which sends a res beck to the client
* Process can communicate using files in the file system 

## Producer-consumer communication

1. The OS creates a pipe to use for communication
2. The producer's outpout is redirected to the pipe's input. Writes are blocked if the pipe is full
3. The consumer's input is redirected if the pipe is empty.
4. When the producer has finished generating output it closes its end of the pipe
5. The consumer will continue reading until it gets to the eof (end of file) marker. It reads that from the pipe and closes its end of the pipe.
