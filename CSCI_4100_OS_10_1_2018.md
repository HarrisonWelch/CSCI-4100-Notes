## Assignment talk

* arg 0 something something
* trap into kernel
* switch into user mode and copy args in the stack
  * passing args
* interupt 
  * aight got system call
  * call this
* kernel stub does sytem call
* lib presents illusion
* aight imma do this by using registers
  * interupt handler will reconstruct what I want
    * then use this to control hardware
* argv0 instead of argv1
* goofed on createProcess
* createProcess returns PID

## The solution causes new problems

Multi-threaded programs

* Independent threads__ operates on complete separate subset of memory
* cooperating threads__ read and writes shared state

Shared impacts correctness

* Interleavings of thread ops on shared state
* Program execution can be nondeterministic

"Heisenbugs" - "In computer programming, heisenbug is a classification of an unusual software bug that disappears or alters its behavior when an attempt to isolate it is made. Due to the unpredictable nature of a heisenbug, when trying to recreate the bug or using a debugger, the error may change or even vanish on a retry."

Structured synchronization

* Structure our programs in order to make it easier
* Standard set of synchronization of primitives

A race condition occurs when the behavior of a program depends on the interleaving of operations in different threads

## Atomic operation

Cannot be interleaved or split by an instruction or operation

Conditions

* Safety: Never have more than one person buying milk
* Liveness: if milk is in fact needed, someone eventually buys it

Solution 1: A roommate leaves a note on the fridge before going to the store

* I'm going to fix this after notifying all that may see this container
* works sometime
* safety is not guaranteed

Solution 2: roommate must check for a note before writing a note

* gauranteed to be safe
* liveness is not gauranteed

Solution 3: make sure one roommate has bought milk before the other roommate decides not to.

* gauranteed and liveness gauranteed
* but inefficient
* busy wait
* "polling"
* resource intense
