The problem with Base and Bound

-> all in one chunck of memory

The first op to do this is multix

* modern multiprogramming features
* all these sorts of things
* Honeywell took over

Then made simple Unix

* named as a joke
* segmentation


## __Segmentations__ breaks up a process memory into variable-sized segments

* All files are segments
* shared memory is a segment
* How does this work?
  * Instead of a simple pair of base & bounds regiters, HW supports an array of pairs, one for each segment
  * Each segment is stored contiguosly,  diff segments can be stored in different locations
  * Typical setup: code, static data, heap, stack
  * Virtual address: segment ID, offset
  * Physical address: use segment table__ indexed by segment id, base + offset
  * Each table entry contains base, bound, permissions
  * Access outside of bounds of a segment
    * segmentation fault!!
  * Advantages: simple and efficient, support shared memory and dynamic allocation of heap & stack
  * Disadvantages: many segments of variable size __external fragmentation__

## __Paging__ breaks up a process memory into fixed-sized pages

* Virtual address: page number, offset
* Physical address: use page number to index a page table
* Page table entry: frame number, permissions
* Physical address: frame number, offset
* Contiguous pages in a process's address space may be stored in non-contiguous page frames
* Allocation: use a bit map where each bit indicates is free or in use
* Shared memoryL OS can use a __core map__ to keep track of how many processes are using a shared page
* Initialization of a processes: pages can be loaded on demand
* Advantages: no bounds checking, no external fragmenation
* Disadvantages: (page size) small pages = flexible but alot of them = very large page table or index for keeping them all. OR! Make the pages bigger. large pages = wasted space or __internal fragmentation__
