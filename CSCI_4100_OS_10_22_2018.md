## Allowing Deadlock

Mechanism

* A way to recover from deadlock with minimal harm to users
* A way to detect when deadlock occurs

## Deadlock recovery

* The system can give the user the option to kill a deadlocked process
  * if the process is deadlocked, you aren't loosing much by killing it. "termination doesn't loose anything"
  * If a thread in the process holds a lock on a shared object
    * The system could be locked in an inconsistent state
* The program is allowed to continue without the requested resources
  * Web services are designed to be resilient when resources are unavailable
  * Deadlocks don't happen all that often aka pretty rare aka tricky to find...
    * handle error corrections carefully

* Operations can preformend using __transactions__
  * if aquiring a lock leads to deadlock system can __rollback__ or undo the thread's actions so other threads can proceed
  * When all the other threads are done, the threads that were rolled back and can be restarted as if the deadlock didn't occur
  * Operations are setup to be atomic operations
    * the intermediate state is only visible to the transaction

## Deadlock detection

* Identify a deadlock if an operation takes too much time
  * conservative approach
  * "wait's for" graph
* The system can consruct a graph where threads & resources are nodes
  * depth first search to find and identify cycles
* Use a variation of the Banker's algorithm
  * don't know max resources are that will be requested by threads
  * check if pending requests can be satisfied if no further requests are made
  * (we are in chapter 6.5 right now)

## Processor scheduling policies

Determine which thread or threads to run first when there are more threads than processors

A __task__ or a __job__ is a user request that is ultimately the focus of the scheduling policy

* The __response time__ is the user-perceived time to preform the task time to perform the task
* __Predictability__ - low variance in response times for repeated request
* __Throughput__ - the rate at which tasks are completed
* __Scheduling overhead__ - time to switch from one task to another
* __Fairness__ - equal resource allocation for each task
* __Starvation__ - a task not making progress b/c a higher proiority task has the resources

## Scheduling a single processor

* A __workload__ - a set of tasks for some system to perform
* A __compute-bound__ - task spends much of its time using the processor
* An __I/O-bound__ - task spends most of its time waiting for I/O operations to complete
* A schduler is __work-conserving__ if it never leaves the processor idle if work is available. Keep the processors busy!
* Most schedulers have the ability to __preempt__ the processor and allocate to another task.

## First in First Out (FIFO) or First Come First Serve (FCFS)

* Always schedule the task that has the order in which they arrive, and keep running until they complete
* Advantages: simple to implement, minimizes overhead
* Disadvantages: Shorter jobs may have to wait for longer jobs to complete avg response time

## Shortest Job First or Shortest remaining job first

* Always schedule the task that has the least remaining work to do first
* Advantages: minimizes response time (best you can do)
* Disadvantages: this impossible
  * require knowledge of the future
  * shorter jobs can starve
