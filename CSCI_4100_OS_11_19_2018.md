16-bit VA

page size is 512 bytes

you need OFFSET of 512 Bytes or 2^9 bytes

```
| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |
| -- page #-- | ---- OFFSET --- |
| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |
```

7 for page number and 9 for OFFSET

VA: 2000 bits / 512 = 3

    2000 % 512 = 464

SO page 3, byte 464 is where our data is

## back to the lesson

A __file system__ is an OS abstraction that provides persistent named data.

* __Persistent data__ is persistent until it is explicitly deleted
* __Named data__ can be accessed using a human readable identifier that allows it to be potentially shared by mulitple applications

## A __file__ is named collection of data in a file system

* A __file name__ can be translated by the operating system into information about where the data in the file is stored
* __File metadata__ includes:
  * files size, 
  * modification time, 
  * owner,
  * permissions
    * who and how can access this file
* __File data__ - sequence of bytes that is organized according to the requirements of the file type
  * file extensions
    * very insecure

## A ___directory___ is a file containing information

This info includes A list of mappings of file names to actual files

* Directories can be containing other directories, forming a hierarchial structure
* A __path__ is a string containing a sequence of directory names seperated by a symbol followed by a file name

Unix
```
path/to/file.txt
```

Windows
```
path\to\file.txt
```

* One directory is designated the __root__ and is not contained by any other directory
  * end up with this tree-like structure
* An __absolute path__ starts with the root directory (`/usr/bin/g++`)
* A __relative path__ is followed starting at the `cwd` or __current working directory__ for the process that's using it
  * Processes have access to a certain number of items
* When a user logs in to a shell one of the things that happens is that the shell is a process
  * said process has a `CWD`
  * the shell changes first to the user's "home" directory
* The mapping of a file name to a file is called a __"hard-link"__

* A __volume__ is a collection of storage resources that make up a logical storage device
  * A volume can correspond to a:
    * single physical device
    * A __partition__ of a device
    * Many physical devices

## Drive names

* A and B are floppy disk drive.
* C is a hard drive.
* D is CD ROM drive

* Volumes can be mounted onto existing file system to make their files and directories accessible through a single hierarchy
