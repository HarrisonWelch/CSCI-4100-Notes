## Some systems have real-time constraints that require computations to be completed by a deadline

* real-time tasks can be allocated more processing power than they need
* An __earliest deadline first (EDF)__ policy can be used
	* The task with the soonest deadline is scheduled first
	* If it is possible to complete all tasks before the deadline, and tasks only used need the processor, EDF gaurantees deadlines will be met
	* Tasks performing I/O may need to be dead broken up into subtasks each w/own deadline
* __Priority inversion__ - high priority task is waiting for a low priority task to complete its work
* __Priority donation__ - a low priority task can temporarily donate its priority to a lower priority task it is waiting for.

### That is it for scheduling

## Memory Management

Still dealing with processes and threads

* processes have there own address space
* __Address translation__ is the conversion of a __vitual address__ used by a process to a __physical address__ in a memory
* Features provided by address translation
  * process isolation
  * Interprocess communication
  * Allows process to also share chunks of memory
  * Shared code segments
    * access management, read-write-execute
  * Program initialization
  * Efficient dynamic memory allocation
    * call stack
    * heap
  * Cache manangement
  * Program debugging
    * ok now I need to check
  * Efficient I/O
  * Memory-mapped files
  * Virtual memory
  * Checkpointing and restart
  * Persistent data structures
  * Process migration
    * computer cluster
    * move from one system to another
  * Information flow control
  * Distributed shared memory

## Address translation

* Memory protection
  * making sure your not writing outside of bounds
  * pointers...
* Memory sharing
  * ability to multitask
  * counterveiling to protection
* Flexible memory placement
* Sparse addresses
  * provide a much larger space to the processor
    * grow or shrink methods
* Runtime lookup efficiencys
* Compact translation tables
  * these tables cant take up that much space
* Portability

## Base and bounds [ address translation ]

* base register - specifies the start of the process's region in memory
* bound register - specifies the size of the region
* vitual addresses start at zero and go up to the bound
* phyiscal address = base + virtual address
* advantages: simple and efficient
* disadvantages:
  * does not support protection within a process
  * shared memory
  * no dynamic memory regions
  * or other useful features
