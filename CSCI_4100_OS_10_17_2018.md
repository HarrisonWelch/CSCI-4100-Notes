A __Deadlock__ occurs when every thread in a set of threads is waiting for an action that can only be performed by another thread in the set.

Example: mutally recursive locking

```c
Thread A
lock1.aquire()
lock2.aquire()
lock2.release()
lock1.release()
```
```c
Thread A
lock2.aquire()
lock1.aquire()
lock1.release()
lock2.release()
```

Both of these are OK, but what about interleaving

'idempotent' operation

Example: The Dining Philosophers

* 5 plates, between them rests a single chopstick

Protocol

Step 1. pick up the left chopstick
Step 2. pick up the right the chopstick
step 3. start eating

This works with 1 and 2 philosophers

If all 5 eat at the same time. then they all grab the left chopstick. they all attempt to aquire the right chopstick where it all ready gone due to step one being fired.

Deadlock is a particular form of starvation

* __Starvation__ occurs when a thread fails to make prograss for an indefinate period of time

Example: RWLocks - if writers always here priority, readers may starve

* Just because a system can suffer starvation or deadlock doesn't mean it will

* similar to race conditions

There are four necessary conditions for deadlock

1. Bounded resources - there is a resource or resources where a finite number of threads can access it or them at one time
    1. contention for resources

2. No preemption - once a thread gets a resources it can NOT be taken away

3. wait while holding, hold-wait condition

4. Circular wait - has to be possible for a circle of flow to be formed
    1. wait-spore graph
    2. a cycle in graph theory

## Deadlock Prevention

1. Eliminate one of the necessary conditions for deadlock

2. Deadlock avoidance.
    1. if we know an action may lead to deadlock, we just make the thread wait until it's safe to do so.
    2. delay the action until it may be safe to do so

3. Detect when deadlock occurs, then recover by undoing the actions that lead to deadlock
