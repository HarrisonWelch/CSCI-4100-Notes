# CSCI_4100_OS_9_19_2018

WHat funs do nwe need an OS to provide?

* Memory management
  * not neccessarily talking to the disk
  * more about the Memory (RAM)
* Input/Output
  * interact with hardware
* Graphical User Interace
  * window management
* Interprocessor communication
  * apps talk to each other
* Shared library (even though this is not a technical)
* File systems and storage
* Networking and distributed systems
* Thread management
* Security and Authentication
* Process management
  * haven't really talked about this much
  * diff between thread and process
  * scheduling and dealing with memory/processors 

Where can we put this functionality?

* go in many places
* In a user-level program, where the user Interface tends to go
  * allows user process management
* In a user-level library linked with each application
* In the OS kernel, accessed through a system call
* In a seperate server process access via system-call

How do we make this choice?

Four things to keep in mind

1. Flexibility
* simple system call interface
2. Safety
* resource management and protection must be implemented by the kernel
3. Reliable
* reduce bugs in the kernel by keeping it small
4. Performance
* transferring control to the kernel is expensive

A shell is a job control system

1. The shell prompts for a command
2. The user enteres a command
3. the shell interprets the command, and requests that the OS create a process to execute the command
4. When the command completes, go to step 1

### On Windows, use CreateProcess

1. Creates & initializes the PCB
2. Creates a new address space
3. Loads the program into the address space
4. copies agruments into the address spaces
5. Inits the PC to start execution at start
  * program counter
  * for every running process there is a little chunk of code. a prolog to the program. somthing has to start the program. Call the main function. 
  * also epilogue that exits
6. Informs the scheduler that the new process is ready

* creating processes happens with the OS, so assembly would not really "CreateProcess"

### On UNIX systems there are two system calls to create a process

* The FORK system call creates a complete copy of the parent process

* The EXEC system call is called by the child process to load the exectuable fiel and start running it

## UNIX FORK

1. Creates and inits the PCB
2. Creates a new address space 
3. Inits the address space with a copy of the parent address space 
4. inherits the execution context of the parent
5. Inform the scheduler the new process is ready to run
6. Returns 0 for the child process, and the process ID of the child to the parent

## UNIX EXEC

* just about everything the Windows CreateProcess does that the UNIX FORK doesn't

1. Loads the program into the current address space
2. Copies the arguements into the address space
3. Initializes the PC to "start"

## Other UNIX system calls

* WAIT - waits for a child process to complete
* SIGNAL - sends a message to process using an upcall
* EXIT - tells the kernel that the calling process has completed
