* Virtual memory system depends on hardware support for address translation
* The file system and virtual memory system depend on physical memory and the disk device driver
* The file system may depend on the network protocl stack to access a disk on a remote machine

## How do we address these dependencies

* A __Monolithic kernel__ implementation implements most OS functionality in the kernel
* A __microkernel__ implements as much functionality as it can with user-level servers

## Monolithic kernels use two common techniques

* A __hardware abstraction layer (HAL)__
* __Dynamically loadable device drivers__

## Microkernels

* Windows provide modularity though user-level servers
* Window managers, the network stack, and file systems can be implemented as user-level servers
* The kernel acts as an intermediary between client applications and these servers
* make development easier
  * isolate into components
  * reliaability
  * security increase maybe
* but adding levels of indirection adds overhead
* Most systems use a hybrid mode with some services in kernel and others at user-level

## Concurrency

Define: refers to multiple activities that can happen at the same time.

Important for OSs

* mulitple devices, preforming tasks at the same time
* multiple applications at the same time
* OS must be responsive to user-input
  * we don't want it to take forever
  * very frustrating if not responsive
  * good practice
    * all sorts of benefits
* concurrency can improve performance

Import for applications:

* Network services must be able to handle multiple requires at a time
* User interfaces must be responsive to user input 
* Parallel programs must be able to run on multiple processes
* Data management systems

### Concurrency is implemented using a set of interacting threads

* A thread is a sequential stream of execution
* Each thread behaves operates as if it has its own dedicated processor
  * thread is abtraction of processor
* Threads get scheduled, suspended, resumed by the OS.
  * only a subset are actually running on processor
* Coordination is required if multiple threads can access shared data structures

### Threads

* Simplify the structure of a programs that perform multiple independent activities
* Improve responsiveness by having some threads executive background tasks while others handle user input
* Improve performance:
  * executing code on multiple processors at the same time
  * preforming other tasks is waiting
